# Contributing

The bottom line. Follow your Nose, or our Nose. Write-run-love tests :fist:.

## Code of Conduct

Check out the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Don't tl:dr; it, but the general idea is to be nice.

## Got Questions?

Open an issue! Go to https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues. It's possible that your issue was already addressed. If it wasn't, open it. We also accept PRs; take a look at the steps below for instructions on how to do this.

## Setup

### Fork, Clone, Setup Your Version of the Plotly Python API

First, you'll need to *get* our project. This is the appropriate *clone* command (if you're unfamiliar with this process, https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo):

**DO THIS (in the directory where you want the repo to live)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plotly/python-api.git
```

### Submodules

Second, this project uses git submodules! They're both helpful and, at times, difficult to work with. The good news is you probably don't need to think about them! Just run the following shell command to make sure that your local repo is wired properly:

**DO THIS (run this command in your new `plotly-api` directory)**

```bash
make setup_subs
```

That's going to initialize the submodules we use in this project, update them so that they're synced to the proper commit, and copy files to the appropriate locations in your local repo.

Here's what you need to know: changes to any files inside the following directories **will get overwritten**. These are synced with the submodules, if you need to change functionality there, you will need to make a pull request in the appropriate sub project repository.
- chunked_requests
- graph_reference
- mplexporter

Additionally, there are some project shortcuts that live in the `makefile` file. You can read all about this in the `make_instructions.txt` file. OR, just run:

```bash
make readme
```

### Making a Development Branch

Third, *don't* work in the `master` branch. As soon as you get your master branch ready, run:

**DO THIS (but change the branch name)**
```bash
git checkout -b my-dev-branch
```

... where you should give your branch a more descriptive name than `my-dev-branch`

### Pull Request When Ready

Once you've made your changes (and hopefully written some tests...), make that pull request!

## Suggestions

### Local Python
Setting up Python versions that *don't* require you to use `sudo` is a good idea. In addition, the core Python on your machine may not be the Python that we've developed in! Here are some nice guides for Mac, Windows, and Linux:
- http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/
- http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/
- http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/

### Virtualenv
Virtualenv is a way to create Python environments on your machine that know nothing about one another. This is really helpful for ironing out dependency-problems arising from different versions of packages. Here's a nice guide on how to do this: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

### Alter Your PYTHONPATH
The PYTHONPATH variable in your shell tells Python where to look for modules. Since you'll be developing, it'll be a pain to need to *install* Python every time you need to test some functionality (or at least ensure you're running code from the right directory...). You can easily make this change from a shell:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/local/repo:$PYTHONPATH"
```

Note, that's non-permanent. When you close the shell, that variable definition disappears. Also, `path/to/local/repo` is *your* specific repository path (e.g., `/Users/andrew/projects/python-api`).

### Why?

Now you can run the following code and be guaranteed to have a working development version that you can make changes to on-the-fly, test, and be confident will not break on other's machines!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r optional-requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/local/repo:$PYTHONPATH"
```

## Dependencies

There's a short list of core dependencies you'll need installed in your Python environment to have any sort of fun with Plotly's Python API (see `requirements.txt`). Additionally, you're likely to have even more fun if you install some other requirements (see `optional-requirements.txt`).

### Dependencies and Virtualenv

If you decided to follow the suggestion about about the Virtualenv *and* you've run `source bin/activate` within your new virtualenv directory to activate it--you can run the following to install the core dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r optional-requirements.txt
```

## Testing

We take advantage of two tools to run tests:

* [`tox`](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is both a virtualenv management and test tool.
* [`nose`](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), which is is an extension of Python's unittest

### Running Tests with `nose`

Since our tests cover *all* the functionality, to prevent tons of errors from showing up and having to parse through a messy output, you'll need to install `optional-requirements.txt` as explained above.

After you've done that, go ahead and follow (y)our Nose!

```bash
nosetests -w plotly/tests
```

Or for more *verbose* output:

```bash
nosetests -w plotly/tests -v
```

Either of those will run *every* test we've written for the Python API. You can get more granular by running something like:

```bash
nosetests -w plotly/tests/test_plotly
```

... or even more granular by running something like:

```bash
nosetests plotly/tests/test_plotly/test_plot.py
```

### Running tests with `tox`

Running tests with tox is much more powerful, but requires a bit more setup.

You'll need to export an environment variable for *each* tox environment you wish to test with. For example, if you want to test with `Python 2.7` and
`Python 3.4`, but only care to check the `core` specs, you would need to ensure that the following variables are exported:

```
export PLOTLY_TOX_PYTHON_27=<python binary>
export PLOTLY_TOX_PYTHON_34=<python binary>
```

Where the `<python binary` is going to be specific to your development setup. As a more complete example, you might have this loaded in a `.bash_profile` (or equivalent shell loader):

```bash
############
# tox envs #
############

export PLOTLY_TOX_PYTHON_27=python2.7
export PLOTLY_TOX_PYTHON_34=python3.4
export TOXENV=py27-core,py34-core
```

Where `TOXENV` is the environment list you want to use when invoking `tox` from the command line. Note that the `PLOTLY_TOX_*` pattern is used to pass in variables for use in the `tox.ini` file. Though this is a little setup, intensive, you'll get the following benefits:

* `tox` will automatically manage a virtual env for each environment you want to test in.
* You only have to run `tox` and know that the module is working in both `Python 2` and `Python 3`.

Finally, `tox` allows you to pass in additional command line arguments that are formatted in (by us) in the `tox.ini` file, see `{posargs}`. This is setup to help with our `nose attr` configuration. To run only tests that are *not* tagged with `slow`, you could use the following command:

```bash
tox -- -a '!slow'
```

Note that anything after `--` is substituted in for `{posargs}` in the tox.ini. For completeness, because it's reasonably confusing, if you want to force a match for *multiple* `nose attr` tags, you comma-separate the tags like so:

```bash
tox -- -a '!slow','!matplotlib'
```

### Writing Tests

You're *strongly* encouraged to write tests that check your added functionality.

When you write a new test anywhere under the `tests` directory, if your PR gets accepted, that test will run in a virtual machine to ensure that future changes don't break your contributions!

#### Publishing to Pip

You'll need the credentials file `~/.pypirc`. Request access from @theengineear and @chriddyp. Then, from inside the repository:

```bash
(plotly.py) $ git checkout master
(plotly.py) $ git stash
(plotly.py) $ git pull origin master
(plotly.py) $ python setup.py sdist upload # upload to pip
```

After it has uploaded, move to another directly and double+triple check that you are able to upgrade ok:
```bash
$ pip install plotly --upgrade
```

And ask one of your friends to do it too. Our tests should catch any issues, but you never know.

<3 Team Plotly
